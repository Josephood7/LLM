Sentiment analysis on financial and economic information is highly relevant for businesses for several key reasons, ranging from market insights (gain valuable insights into market trends, investor confidence, and consumer behavior) to risk management (identifying potential reputational risks) to investment decisions (gauging the sentiment of stakeholders, investors, and the general public businesses can assess the potential success of various investment opportunities).\n\nBefore the technicalities of fine-tuning a large language model like Llama 3, we have to find the correct dataset to demonstrate the potentialities of fine-tuning.\n\nParticularly within the realm of finance and economic texts, annotated datasets are notably rare, with many being exclusively reserved for proprietary purposes. To address the issue of insufficient training data, scholars from the Aalto University School\nof Business introduced in 2014 a set of approximately 5000 sentences. This collection aimed to establish human-annotated benchmarks, serving as a standard for evaluating alternative modeling techniques. The involved annotators (16 people with\nadequate background knowledge on financial markets) were instructed to assess the sentences solely from the perspective of an investor, evaluating whether the news potentially holds a positive, negative, or neutral impact on the stock price.\n\nThe FinancialPhraseBank dataset is a comprehensive collection that captures the sentiments of financial news headlines from the viewpoint of a retail investor. Comprising two key columns, namely \"Sentiment\" and \"News Headline,\" the dataset effectively classifies sentiments as either negative, neutral, or positive. This structured dataset serves as a valuable resource for analyzing and understanding the complex dynamics of sentiment in the domain of financial news. It has been used in various studies and research initiatives, since its inception in the work by Malo, P., Sinha, A., Korhonen, P., Wallenius, J., and Takala, P.  \"Good debt or bad debt: Detecting semantic orientations in economic texts.\", published in the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology in 2014.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a first step, we install the specific libraries necessary to make this example work.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* accelerate is a distributed training library for PyTorch by HuggingFace. It allows you to train your models on multiple GPUs or CPUs in parallel (distributed configurations), which can significantly speed up training in presence of multiple GPUs (we won't use it in our example).\n* peft is a Python library by HuggingFace for efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs.\n* bitsandbytes by Tim Dettmers, is a lightweight wrapper around CUDA custom functions, in particular 8-bit optimizers, matrix multiplication (LLM.int8()), and quantization functions. It allows to run models stored in 4-bit precision: while 4-bit bitsandbytes stores weights in 4-bits, the computation still happens in 16 or 32-bit and here any combination can be chosen (float16, bfloat16, float32, and so on).\n* transformers is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). It provides a number of pre-trained models for NLP tasks such as text classification, question answering, and machine translation.\n* trl is a full stack library by HuggingFace providing a set of tools to train transformer language models with Reinforcement Learning, from the Supervised Fine-tuning step (SFT), Reward Modeling step (RM) to the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Installations and imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/trl@a3c5b7178ac4f65569975efadc97db2f3749c65e","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-31T09:33:25.128741Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-31T09:33:25.129427Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-31T09:33:42.382688Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-31T09:33:25.129378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-31T09:33:42.381616Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install wurlitzer\n!pip uninstall keras --yes\n!pip install keras==\"2.15.0\"\n!pip uninstall tensorboard --yes\n!pip install tensorboard==\"2.15\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-31T08:48:52.807970Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-31T08:48:52.808701Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-31T08:49:46.230222Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-31T08:48:52.808663Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-31T08:49:46.229123Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -q -U torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117\n!pip install -q -U -i https://pypi.org/simple/ bitsandbytes\n!pip install -q -U transformers==\"4.40.0\"\n!pip install -q -U accelerate\n!pip install -q -U datasets\n!pip install -q -U trl\n!pip install -q -U peft\n#!pip install -q -U tensorboard","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-31T08:53:38.410078Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-31T08:53:38.410812Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-31T08:54:58.790272Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-31T08:53:38.410772Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-31T08:54:58.789173Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The code imports the os module and sets two environment variables:\n* CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: This environment variable tells PyTorch which GPUs to use.
