travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year

then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance, you need field service.","Sentence2":"The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business

SCM.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"This is a long-term direction that we're going to continue making more ranking changes and building more products around, but I think that this is kind of reflected broadly in the numbers that you see on engagement and the growth in daily actives and how people are engaging across the family of apps.","Sentence2":"I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone pretty well and has done what we had hoped, although we've made a number of changes.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so the fact that there's so much consumer video, that gives us the opportunity to do more marketing video as well.","Sentence2":"So, to the first question, video is a big opportunity for us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings.","Sentence2":"Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing

one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink.","Sentence2":"You can use the self-service tool.","label":0,"pc":"No

had double digit growth in Greater China.","Sentence2":"We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And if the ads can be well-targeted, we think we'll be able to see engagement, and we already see that.","Sentence2":"And that I think is a big social issue that is eroding the social fabric of the whole society, not just our country, but around the world.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of

right now it\u2019s actually pretty diversified.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We have, as I said earlier, selection expansion, infrastructure investments, fulfillment network and AWS

put resources and sales resources behind collaboration and communication, and so many of the important workloads that allow us to give great value to customers.","Sentence2":"Our goal and I think the real opportunity that remains with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 going forward, is our ability to continue to grow the installed base, and to also continue to grow our ARPU.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We did begin shipping units in the quarter.","Sentence2":"It's not going to have a material impact on revenue in 2016,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And one of the reasons we were able to scale into Instagram ads more quickly is because we were building off of the Facebook advertiser

advantage.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And then also, we're just supporting the global growth of the platform.","Sentence2":"So there's going to be a variety of contributions to that

second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half.","Sentence2":"We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Yes, the shipping costs are going to be very tied to AFN unit growth and also the impact often greater Prime adoption and faster shipping methods.","Sentence2":"So we consider that a very strong quarter as down sequentially in the growth that we've seen recently.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That means those people are seeing less relevant ads and that\u2019s an ad targeting headwind for our business.","Sentence2":"The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"On AWS revenue, let me just remind you that quarterly growth last year on an FX-neutral basis, so Q1 was 48%, then 49%, then 46% and 46%.","Sentence2":"So in the first half of the year, we have a tougher comp, if you will, versus some strong growth in the first-half of last year.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We've talked about the drivers of supply being growth in DAU, growth in time spent per DAU and ad load, and obviously, we've given stats around rough stats around \u2013 we've given specific stats around DAU.","Sentence2":"I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in Facebook mobile News Feed.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I talked about the three factors that contributed to growth this quarter: ad demand, users and engagement and ad load.","Sentence2":"It's just worth noting that it is up significantly from where we were two years ago.","label":0,"pc":"No

them as well but it's also companies like HBO which are using those ads to drive adoption and downloads.","Sentence2":"When you think about mobile app install ads, those are an important but relatively small part of our revenue.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So, Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria.","Sentence2":"So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There is still a need for those on-premise products.","Sentence2":"On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern modular SaaS service.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So when you think about our cloud, you got to think about the low-level infrastructure.","Sentence2":"So these are all got a different profile in terms of margin and they are all now pretty high growth businesses for us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So we think it's a very attractive platform for people to reach people with video messages.","Sentence2":"On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So North America operating margin up a 120 basis points year-over-year to 3.9%.","Sentence2":"Lot of good cost efficiency, but again we're continuing to invest so actively as we build the Prime platform

businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth.","Sentence2":"And the one thing I\u2019d mention is the having compliance security that spans all of these tools, is also proving out to be a very big architectural advantage in a customer value proposition because I think, our customers look to use more SaaS applications, they don't want an exponential increase in their security exposure or more compliance burden.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I think we're going to need many more than 33,000.","Sentence2":"I'd say we're

great progress with Stories as a format for people to share on our platforms.","Sentence2":"I think getting that ramp will take a while because Stories is a new format, and we definitely see that it takes a while for advertisers to adopt new formats.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So many years ago when the homepage ticker was in vogue, we never did that.","Sentence2":"So, to the

maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.","Sentence2":"And if you compare that to traditional

year-over-year, similar growth rates year-over-year to what we've seen in some of the earlier quarters of this year.","Sentence2":"So that's, of course, a mix of strength in the U.S. and also strength

I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.","Sentence2":"We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work

targeting, the same measurement systems really work.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we did have some large Azure contracts which tend to be longer dated and tend to have low billings upfront.","Sentence2":"That means it shows up in bookings and again not in the unearned balance in the same way, and so you will see as we go forward and you are already starting to see it more volatility in this number, not just based on the way we\u2019ve traditionally talked about it which is the movement of the expiration base but also in some of these larger and longer term commitments

we feel like we're delivering value for advertisers and publishers, so we're investing behind the growth we've seen.","Sentence2":"We think we're uniquely placed to bring people-based marketing to

there is a great case for not just our business, but also for the user experience on Facebook to have targeting because we think it's a better experience for the people who use Facebook to have targeted ads.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Because there are a lot of really big and important Chinese companies who sell a lot of products to people outside of China, and they use Facebook as one of their primary tools in a lot of cases to spread information about what they're doing and grow their customer base.","Sentence2":"For now, the thing that I would leave you with is that people think that Facebook isn't in China at all and that's actually not true.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And these are modules that there isn't an installed base of those anywhere, no competition even exist.","Sentence2":"And so we feel that we\u2019ve plenty of opportunity ahead.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"On payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it especially in products like Messenger that where the business interaction maybe a bit more transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions that you need.","Sentence2":"So, we

saying, hey, I want to watch video content now.","Sentence2":"So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that

least exposure to the transactional business.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It also really takes people further down the funnel from seeing an ad to having a direct connection with

say I think most people assume \u2013 and it is true to a certain extent \u2013 so much of this is the growth in our Commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And certainly, everything that we've seen since then suggests that, that is right.","Sentence2":"I mean, my own take of this, I think this has gone

because it allows the mobile carriers to not have to have the whole supply chain and sales and retail that they have otherwise, they're able to sell the data plans for on average about 10% less than

when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products.","Sentence2":"because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people

cost-effective and efficient.","Sentence2":"The way we designed Dynamics 365, both on the technology front as well as on the business model front was to get away from what I would describe as the old-school suite-based selling or suite-based building of these things, whether it's CRM or ERP or SCM.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And now we have 1,900 third-party skills for the Alexa, including new skills from Kayak, Lyft, NBC, Honeywell and more.","Sentence2":"A lot ties into our Prime Music offering.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well.","Sentence2":"So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3

that on the Pro side.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So if you spend more time in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer ads in there.","Sentence2":"I think we're getting people up the curve well this time.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.","Sentence2":"So

it\u2019s national.","Sentence2":"So, I would expect that we\u2019ll see different countries make progress on different timeframes.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There\u2019s a foreign

certain item, targeting people who are interested in a certain item, we think that's very substantial.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That ultimately will flow through into how we can

like an assistant with them all the time.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"That generally went to service that 40% growth in units, in AFN units.","Sentence2":"But I would say that we are going to continue to invest in fulfillment centers as long as our AFN growth rate maintains high, and we certainly want to keep that high and growing.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So,

growth that's significant in that segment even as we reinvest into it, given the top line signal.","Sentence2":"Now, if you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment, in particular the way I tend to think about that, as you've seen, we're now 20% growth this quarter in that server and product services KPI, 17% on a constant currency

business 12 months a year for us.","Sentence2":"It's all about supplementing our existing capacity both our partners and ourselves and essentially building capacity that can handle this top line

little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.","Sentence2":"And frankly over time and watching, I think both the creativity and the pace of innovation we\u2019ve seen coming out of our engineering teams particularly in Azure and Office 365

to remember, at Microsoft, we do have a lot of different business that we do with the customers, which may include some things like refreshes of their on-premise infrastructure all the way to some

stretching on both sides, which is to small business on one end and then these premium SKUs on the other end.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The very first thing and I think Satya even mentioned it in its most direct in SMB is moving from buying a copy of Office, which was a very static concept to the idea where you could buy Office and frankly get all the benefits that those who

looking forward to our partner conference to talk much more about what it is that we will be doing in the coming year to drive more success for our partners and in particular ISVs.","Sentence2":"So

exciting to see.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago

tremendously.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot","Sentence2":"So we're happy with that and we think that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent \u2013 user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.","Sentence2":"So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent, continue to see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There is going to be very ability the variability is really two things.","Sentence2":"But I would say in terms of sustainability are quarter to quarter, Satya is right.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago.","Sentence2":"We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But we're happy with the growth there.","Sentence2":"I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And when we get to Q4 we\u2019re going to be lapping some particularly successful optimizations that we had in Q4 and that\u2019s going to contribute to more of a decel in Q4 than we think we\u2019ll see in Q3.","Sentence2":"So there\u2019s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so, I suspect you will see a similar pattern on a similar desire by Satya to continue to invest toward growth especially on the commercial side.","Sentence2":"In MPC, I generally expect he will continue to see improvement through the year just based on the mix of products that we will have over the course of the year, that's not new.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab.","Sentence2":"So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so this volatility that we are going to see because of macro and because of budget constraints, especially on Transactional, we will focus on because we expect excellent execution and have accountability to do that in the field.","Sentence2":"But at the same time, we still will focus on those deals moving to the cloud over time.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Apple Watch is not only a new product, but it\u2019s a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative technologies.","Sentence2":"And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you.","Sentence2":"So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The Watch is getting some traction there.","Sentence2":"China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app developer point of view.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that.","Sentence2":"And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And they're just doing an amazing job.","Sentence2":"They've cared deeply about it since the first conversations I've had with Kevin.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So what we find through the research is that for every 10 people who get connected to the Internet, just a little less than or right around one person gets lifted out of poverty and one new job gets created.","Sentence2":"And there's a lot of research that we've seen and reports that third parties have put out that show, that when you connect to place like India, it makes a very big difference socially and for the economy there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And the same thing with advanced analytics.","Sentence2":"Yeah, and also it sort of comes in interesting ways because one of the things IT, as you know, it\u2019s not about sort of replacing what you have, it\u2019s always augmenting what you have.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So there is always a - generally a sequential drop in Q4.","Sentence2":"We think AWS is that.","label":0,"pc":"No

so we think that certainly we want to provide the best advertising, we certainly want to provide the best measurement, but our ability to do so as long as things happen across the industry, which is what's happening, I think we remain in a very strong position.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And then in terms of does that have any meaningful contribution from areas of innovation, we talked about some of the areas that we're investing in.","Sentence2":"And the reason why we're confident that we can get this right is because there have been several elections since the 2016 ones that have had much better results, including the French presidential election, the German elections, the Alabama special election, and the Mexican election about a month ago.","label":0,"pc":"No

consume.","Sentence2":"And that's just a big thing that we're continuing to focus on.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I would say that we have 23 sort centers, which allows us to control a lot more of our shipments for longer.","Sentence2":"But we certainly value our relationships with USPS, FedEx, UPS and other global carriers.","label":2,"pc":"Attack"},{"Sentence1":"It really depends what that would be.","Sentence2":"When you think about the way people have the choice to restrict data use, I think it would affect the product.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That's a bunch of hard work that goes into making our ads more targeted that makes the outcomes that advertisers get more valuable.","Sentence2":"I think it's a huge opportunity.","label":0,"pc":"No

factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We were up 71% year over year.","Sentence2":"Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates

the innovation pace continues to accelerate.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And while the political campaign, obviously, a lot a money is spend in ads.","Sentence2":"And so, with all of these events taking place around the world, there's no one event that we think drives a huge portion of revenue.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective.","Sentence2":"However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So to what I said in my transcript before, 1.5 million SMBs posting videos in one month alone.","Sentence2":"And what you see is that it's as easy for them to use it as profile and we can give them

saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1.","Sentence2":"We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth.","Sentence2":"So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It grew 53% year-over-year versus 52% in Q1.","Sentence2":"So, we continue to see strong Prime membership

we have differentiation and we want to focus on it.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor.","Sentence2":"So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We never had that kind of a management footprint.","Sentence2":"We definitely are seeing one-for-one migration, but the

that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought","Sentence2":"In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So for example, when GDPR came into effect, we saw a number of people who opted out on allowing us to use context from the apps and websites they visited for ad targeting.","Sentence2":"I think we have been and continue

you're starting to see is a process whereby there's a great product, there's a good macro environment.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other.","Sentence2":"And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"They want to be able to instantaneously use and get value very quickly and that's something we've actually seen and a real testament to our ability to add so many customers in every quarter.","Sentence2":"One of the important things that's distinct about the small business market is that there tends not to be much of a lag in terms of buying and deployment.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And compared to the industry peers, we're obviously gaining share with Windows Server, on SQL Server, and pretty much all of our

a bit of a rebound.","label":2,"pc":"Attack"},{"Sentence1":"If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate.","Sentence2":"And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of

that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers.","Sentence2":"I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"On China, that is a more complex situation.","Sentence2":"So over the long-term, that is a situation that we will need to try to figure out a way forward on.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out","Sentence2":"This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Are we executing well on it?","Sentence2":"That being said, I don't view any OpEx number as a constraint.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I think the good news we have here is that mobile first video on Facebook right now is now over 50% of video

last quarter,","Sentence2":"and so we feel very good about that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The third one is operational efficiency.","Sentence2":"And we feel, at Microsoft, we're well

very common platform both for first party workloads as well as our third party business.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We've got 4 million advertisers on Facebook; 0.5 million advertisers on Instagram.","Sentence2":"I think when you look at our business, demand has been one of the key factors driving growth.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It builds better customer loyalty both to that brand and also to Amazon.","Sentence2":"And then, I guess, we're very focused on serving brands as well.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So we\u2019ve built that into our Q4 guidance estimate, but we\u2019re very pleased with the customer response to One Day.","Sentence2":"Once again the ops team has really done yeoman\u2019s work here to create this capacity for us

headwind of more than 100 basis points.","Sentence2":"And so we enter the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"There are two broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make.","Sentence2":"But we've also been innovating over the past several years.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce.","Sentence2":"And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And that's not the world we're on on mobile.","Sentence2":"So I really am very committed to this idea of making sure that the next platform reflects those values that Facebook stands for.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences.","Sentence2":"This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China.","label":0,"pc":"No

content.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"and that's why we're working to actively expand those partnerships.","Sentence2":"We're very interested in making sure that marketers can verify or measure outcomes through third-parties,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017, it's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent \u2013 user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand.","Sentence2":"And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And we can do better with people, but ultimately the best thing that we can do is build AI systems that can watch a video and understand that it's going to be problematic and violate the policies of our community and that people aren't going to want to see it and then just not show it to people before bad experiences happen and things like violence gets spread through \u2013 violent content gets spread through the network.","Sentence2":"So, for visual content, we want to be able to look at a photo and understand what's in it, right, and whether that's something that you're going to be interested in, right?","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Well, in Echo, again, we continue to build out the list of devices, launching the Dot and Tab and Fire TV skills this past year.","Sentence2":"A lot ties into our Prime Music offering.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We already have 5 million advertisers on Facebook, 1 million advertisers on Instagram.","Sentence2":"We do think that the advertiser base and the targeting and the measurement we offer once we figure out the format will be a very considerable advantage.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The layer about that for me is the data state, one of the exciting things is the growth in Azure DB, the growth in Cosmos DB, data warehouse product, the Datalake, so that is a place where we are seeing significant attach.","Sentence2":"Yes, I mean I think we have premium services whether it\u2019s an Office 365 or in the SaaS side with a Dynamic 365 and that\u2019s where the SharePoint comment came, but there is a lot more in Office 365 adoption cycle beyond exchange or email.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app developer point of view.","Sentence2":"India, we set a new first-half record.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And then on the technology side, as you said, yes we will continue and invest in SDEs and software engineers to build these you know products that customers love, continue to respond to their demands, and that will push or inform our product portfolio.","Sentence2":"On the rest of the P&L, there again we have, I believe some of the best infrastructure people in the industry.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides.","Sentence2":"I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"A few years ago, we probably would\u2019ve rolled this out and tried to deal with issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground up, getting this right upfront.","Sentence2":"But some of the things we\u2019re also going to intentionally take a longer period of time than we might have previously in order to get safety right.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in.","Sentence2":"But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling.","Sentence2":"Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Even there we now have premium offerings and then we have higher level services.","Sentence2":"So these are all got a different profile in terms of margin and they are all now pretty high growth businesses for us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That's a trend that's not new for us.","Sentence2":"So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I referenced the MSQRD app that we acquired earlier in my remarks.","Sentence2":"And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And at the same time we're seeing continued pricing growth on feed, and that's true for both Facebook and Instagram.","Sentence2":"And there, we're relying on continuing to improve targeting.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That roadmap, we know that those devices drive customer engagement and sales.","Sentence2":"I can't forecast into the future on that but I will reiterate the investments we have going on right now which again, we're looking to invest to strengthen the Prime platform.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"One of the factors driving that is that's where we're categorizing our community operations investment and other operations teams that support the quality initiatives and the safety initiatives.","Sentence2":"If I had to point to what's really leading us to tighten the range, it's really the first factor which is the safety and security investments","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And then Brazil was particularly weak last Q3.","Sentence2":"One thing that I would cite there, it's just how we manage ad load and balance some of our internal promotion units and sort of use it as internal house spend and the nature of the changes that we made in that had a more pronounced impact in some of the lower ARPU countries and unlocked more impression growth in those markets.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"because we have that position in the client server space.","Sentence2":"We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"because there aren't enough of them and they haven't been rolled out for long enough.","Sentence2":"It's really too early to understand the impact of the ads on consumers","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP.","Sentence2":"because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach.","Sentence2":"It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Do we expand our footprint, our percentage of the IT budget at a customer?","Sentence2":"So that I think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So it is true that the deals are much broader, deeper.","Sentence2":"And in these very large transactions, many of which we've been signing recently, where you'll see some of that volatility would be in bookings.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase.","Sentence2":"Number one I would say, we have - when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we saw that video and actually didn't take it down and helped get in touch with law enforcement who used that live video to communicate with that person and help save their life.","Sentence2":"A lot of what we're trying to do here is not just about getting content off Facebook.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries?","Sentence2":"The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago.","Sentence2":"So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So in addition, we've expanded grocery delivery to 20 cities so that's picking up steam.","Sentence2":"So, it was a big quarter for Whole Foods and Prime.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account

year.","Sentence2":"Well, I will point out that this quarter showed a lot of innovation, a lot of new products and features and a lot of investment.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But I think in consumer, it\u2019s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan.","Sentence2":"They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So, even though obviously it comes at a little lower gross margin percentage, our ability to add workloads, add premium services and to increase our overall footprint inside a customer is really where the life time value goes up.","Sentence2":"As you pointed out, there is a couple components that make gross profit dollars per seat or the life time value of a customer depending on the terms you want to use improve and increase over the life

were a little bit higher than that number in total cost.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And they targeted millennials and early tech adopters.","Sentence2":"I think it's worth adding that the ad inventory itself is really valuable for marketers and our clients and also works very well with our other ad products,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"These are people who are using Facebook and this free product to create an online and increasingly a mobile presence.","Sentence2":"And building a mobile presence is even harder than a web presence","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do.","Sentence2":"I mean, overall we did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real world needs across the globe.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%.","Sentence2":"We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way.","Sentence2":"And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook community,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So we deliver, really quickly, a couple of ways.","Sentence2":"And so we're taking a long-term approach and doing what we normally do, which is really focus on continuing to drive greater and greater efficiency.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth.","Sentence2":"And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"28% growth in Q3, FX neutral, was helped quite a bit by Prime Day and kind of the strengthening of Prime Day in a number of locales.","Sentence2":"So we're -- continue to be pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, adding Prime benefits, adding devices, adding video content, adding AmazonFresh, Prime Now, giving a lot of value to the Prime customers in the international countries as well and also in that numbers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action.","Sentence2":"However, there's a number of plans that people began signing up for in the last year that could change it.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern.","Sentence2":"The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And I think it's important to note that the regulatory and platform changes will have a disproportionate impact on the ability of small businesses to use ads to grow and thrive.","Sentence2":"So when you think about the shopping experience or the checkout experience on Instagram, these are still very early days, and we're working hard to improve the product and expand to more businesses.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"But we also work very hard at efficiencies and scaling the businesses that we have.","Sentence2":"So we take both roles very seriously around here, investing on the right \u2013 in the right things, seeing results on behalf of customers, and also driving efficiencies.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And one other point I think I made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for Azure.","Sentence2":"We are seeing tremendous growth of Minecraft expansion on mobile platform in China.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required.","Sentence2":"And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That includes video content including Amazon Originals, Prime Music, Prime Now.","Sentence2":"We build fulfillment centers so that we can add selection and we can add FBA partners.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So, now that with a SaaS approach, you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world, is one opportunity.","Sentence2":"The second opportunity is, if you look at Teams, as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services.","Sentence2":"Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so that\u2019s iPad, it\u2019s Mac and those are huge numbers as well.","Sentence2":"I think it's accurate to save those type of markets.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"But when we look at what we're doing in the cloud, it's mostly about attaching to one of the secular growth trajectories going forward, be it open source Linux development, mobile use and SaaS applications.","Sentence2":"So clearly we are migrating some workloads and structurally, some of that helps us","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people.","Sentence2":"I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It has connections to the video and kind of live content services that we're building out.","Sentence2":"Over the long term, there surely will be in -- a connection between the work that we're doing in the Facebook app and Oculus, or there will be opportunities for that.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"because there\u2019s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls.","Sentence2":"I mean it\u2019s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone.","Sentence2":"If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"It's not \u2013 it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done.","Sentence2":"And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there.","Sentence2":"The smartphone has not done as well in India in general.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That includes building products around Facebook and Instagram and continuing to improve those but also in new developing areas like AR\/VR.","Sentence2":"And then we're continuing to invest heavily in our innovation investments.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We have a lot of hard work to do to get to all of our ad campaigns having that kind of measurement.","Sentence2":"But the more we can do it, even in studies with each client, the better our ads get.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We have pillars of the business right now with Marketplace, AWS and Prime and we're actively looking for a fourth and fifth pillar.","Sentence2":"We'll continue to invest in fulfillment space to handle higher and higher paid unit volumes and shipped unit volumes.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.","Sentence2":"So we factor that in, and then there\u2019s also two other issues.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We now have the ability to take Linux workloads and run them first class and over 20% plus of Azure is Linux workloads, which was sort of a growth opportunity we tapped into with the cloud which we didn't have previously.","Sentence2":"Yeah, the thing, Heather, the move to the cloud has done for us is expanded the market opportunity that we have had more than ever before.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And what we see there is again, original content is a fixed cost expense.","Sentence2":"We've garnered awards, of course, but mainly that what we're focused on is good content that is attractive to customers.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses.","Sentence2":"The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And it's really just continuing to learn more and more about the people who are using Facebook and what types of ads they interact with and the like.","Sentence2":"In terms of what the opportunity there is to drive it, it's really about increasing the relevance and quality of the ads.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too.","Sentence2":"And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"There is going to be very ability the variability is really two things.","Sentence2":"So I think the directionality of sustainability is correct and I think the variability can certainly occur from any of the reasons Satya talked about.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I'm particularly happy about the Volkswagen alliance that we've joined up with them to power their Volkswagen Industrial Cloud.","Sentence2":"We're continuing to engage with many large customers

areas like news, which I\u2019ve recently started talking about.","Sentence2":"So, we want to make sure we do this in a consultative away with a lot of folks in journalism and in the industry.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It has to go all the way through for this to work from discovery, all the way through a pretty seamless checkout flow.","Sentence2":"So, the integration you spoke of are the right ones we want.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it.","Sentence2":"And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We are clearly investing for the growth of both Facebook at its core and then also the additional services that we're bringing on.","Sentence2":"So on CapEx, we are absolutely investing in the infrastructure and 2015 is an investment year, so we are ramping CapEx versus 2014.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That\u2019s what I\u2019d expect because of the, first amendment here is a strong protections on speech.","Sentence2":"And so we\u2019re trying to do our part to help advocate for a good regulatory framework in each area and they will come in different forms.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2.","Sentence2":"There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It's also probably worth noting that the experiences we had to date, moving from Facebook to Instagram, were more similar, that the Instagram feed is similar to the Facebook feed in terms of what you can do with advertising.","Sentence2":"We continue to make progress with monetization.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"That's important for all companies.","Sentence2":"We're doing this for a number of reasons.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And one of the ways that we're talking about decentralization is through end-to-end encryption in messaging.","Sentence2":"I do generally - I mean, I believe very strongly in trying to decentralize and put power in individual's hands.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"While we're on this subject of head count, head count grew 77% year-over-year in the quarter.","Sentence2":"So a lot of the additional pickup in Q3 was tied to our ramp for the holidays.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"They also touched on a number of the other issues that we face, including foreign interference in elections and that's something that we're incredibly focused on.","Sentence2":"And on the testimony, these are important issues and I think that that was an important moment to be able to go and hear what people were wondering about and just to have a public hearing of answering all of the questions around Cambridge Analytica and what we knew and all the steps that we're taking on data privacy and developers to make sure that this doesn't happen again and to lay out all the different things that we're doing.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But I would say the biggest impact so far, both on the top line lift and also the bottom line cost is in the U.S.","Sentence2":"Yes, most of the expense has been in the U.S., but we have also increased our One Day selection internationally.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, and in fact our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years.","Sentence2":"You can tell by that we\u2019re a big believer in China.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I mean, the next closest usage of the next competitor, we're six times greater.","Sentence2":"I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.","Sentence2":"We see a lot of growth there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion.","Sentence2":"So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It would be a huge difference.","Sentence2":"I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"One thing that we know that's not going to change is that advertisers are always looking for the highest ROI opportunity.","Sentence2":"And what's most important in winning budget is our relative performance in the industry, and we believe we'll continue to do very well on that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like auto play in feed, but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp.","Sentence2":"And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And if you look at this last quarter, our annuity grew double digits and our cloud grew triple digits.","Sentence2":"And the way we track progress is to see how is our annuity growth of our server business, and how is our cloud growth.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So there's an increasing focus on objectionable content, right, and a lot of unfortunate things, right, that people share on

continuing to hire and hire across a number of locations.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic.","Sentence2":"So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago.","Sentence2":"So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We saw some growth.","Sentence2":"We did and we're encouraged by the customer reaction, even our transactional customers, to the security and management value prop as well as the hybrid nature of our SQL

that we've rolled out as we have this past quarter and gotten to a really good product offering, combined the creative format of Instagram which is very visually compelling and has a lot of engagement from people with the back-end infrastructure and marketer base that Facebook has.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It's impact on Prime and we think Prime and FBA are self-reinforcing.","Sentence2":"So we like those combined, and we are working very hard to match that with capacity in an efficient manner.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And going forward, we have a fantastic lineup of servers, not just the infrastructure, but even SharePoint, Exchange, Lync Server continues to have significant on-premise deployment.","Sentence2":"We

product you use really depends upon what you're trying to do.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, that\u2019s definitely not an impact on that number.","Sentence2":"The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Do they rely on us for more products and more services?","Sentence2":"So that I think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We protect the consumer product and the consumer engagement.","Sentence2":"But we really want to emphasize, especially since there are so many questions on Messenger monetization on this call, that we're going to be slow and deliberate.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of, that can load quickly, that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see, and we're working on a lot of different tools for that.","Sentence2":"Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar.","Sentence2":"So the number would have been even better.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We also look at our pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline","Sentence2":"And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so, that's going to have an impact on impression rate growth.","Sentence2":"as people spend more time with video, and more time is going to video, that is going to have a limiting factor to how much time they spend in News Feed.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that.","Sentence2":"So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I'll also point out that we rolled out the global Prime Video offer in the second half of last \u2013 or, excuse me, in Q4.","Sentence2":"And this takes us to over 200 more countries.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And clearly that's increasing engagement as well and that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those business solutions we mentioned.","Sentence2":"We also, during that one year, done integrations.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We\u2019re growing the number of stores.","Sentence2":"You can tell by that we\u2019re a big believer in China.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products so that all SMBs can use

Office 365 all the way to E5 with significant value.","Sentence2":"So this is whether it's in healthcare, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, just not knowledge workers, but where you now have messaging solutions, as well as business process workflows integrated.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I would say that it's primarily driven by growth in Facebook mobile News Feed.","Sentence2":"It's a good user experience.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile.","Sentence2":"As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Both sequentially and year-over-year.","Sentence2":"That being said, our commercial under balance is seeing good growth I'm proud of our performance this quarter.","label":0,"pc":"No

increasing the strength of the community.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The other is the move to gross versus net accounting on the Instant Articles product.","Sentence2":"There's really two kind main \u2013 two big factors in that compression there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter.","Sentence2":"We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported.","Sentence2":"But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes.","Sentence2":"From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year.","Sentence2":"And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There were even apps like PAS .","Sentence2":"There were lots of different services.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate.","Sentence2":"When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So it\u2019s a regulatory approval question in India at this point and we had a license to roll it out as part of an initial test, the test went better than we even expected it would.","Sentence2":"So, I\u2019m quite confident that when we can roll this out broadly it\u2019s going to be meaningfully valuable to the user experience.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So ,and obviously we'll be working on the efficiencies of all the warehouses we have, including the ones we just started up this year.","Sentence2":"But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico.","Sentence2":"So \u2013 and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning,","Sentence2":"So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And our mobile app install ads help apps of all kinds, not those running on our platform.","Sentence2":"So we think the investigatory work we're doing into APIs, into the use, is very important, and we don't expect it to have an impact on revenue.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But I would say this was an extraordinary step up, as I mentioned, in Q3 that is tied to very rapid growth in not only paid units but Amazon fulfilled units.","Sentence2":"So the content that we are creating, especially through Amazon Studios, we are generally holding the worldwide rights to and can use that in other countries as well.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We were very full.","Sentence2":"It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I think a lot of this comes down to the graphs in the community that you have in the different places.","Sentence2":"There are a number of differences.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service.","Sentence2":"We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising.","Sentence2":"So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We're also very excited about India, if you take a look at our results for \u2013 from an operating profit standpoint, you see that it was approximately negative 76 million on a dollar basis.","Sentence2":"So, I think you'll see a

27%.","Sentence2":"It's showing the success we're having with customers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.","Sentence2":"We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility.","Sentence2":"And so that's the transformation at play.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We're seeing good progress on both of them, and interestingly, insurance companies have been pretty active both on Facebook and Instagram, so we're optimistic about that.","Sentence2":"On the auto and insurance verticals, they're both still small which makes them good opportunities to grow.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we're not really trying to optimize for any particular number in a given quarter.","Sentence2":"The other thing I would add to that is that the margin you see in any quarter is really the output of our rate of investment at some places and drive for efficiencies in others.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter.","Sentence2":"And we're really proud of the growth of the business.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter.","Sentence2":"And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365.","Sentence2":"I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So as I've said a number of times before, our mission is to connect everyone in the world, and it's hard to do that over the long term if we don't find a way to serve more than a billion people who live in China","Sentence2":"So that's certainly a thing that we're going to look out at over the long term.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units.","Sentence2":"And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Essentially for

pickup.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And that's where a lot of the transformation we have done internally is helping us accelerate our Cloud business.","Sentence2":"But I think, in general, the goal is to have -- and continue to build on that business, but certainly, that would be where the \"volatility\" would show up.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"because our

to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office.","Sentence2":"I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And if you think about the connection to why that happens it's not just a terrific engineering work that we've done in product value, it's also the investments that we've made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've added resources that we're seeing the

so while we feel great about continuing to add seats at that type of rate, converting and adding net new into our install base, you will see that growth rate come down just because the business is

deeper.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Let me be clear on this, that people do not want false news or hate speech or bullying or any of the bad content that we're talking

way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"But at the same time, we are going to have

sure that the next platform reflects those values that Facebook stands for.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And what that encompasses is both the Office 365 value proposition, but also our management and security value proposition with EMS as well as Advanced Threat Protection and Windows value that shows up in that Windows commercial services KPI.","Sentence2":"And I'm actually going to expand my comments a little bit because the sales motion is really broader than Office 365.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have.","Sentence2":"Now the good news is \u2013 the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We do have the WhatsApp Business app, which is helping businesses connect with consumers, and that's growing well but that monetization opportunity is not available.","Sentence2":"We remain very focused on the

for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide though several different price points for our customers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones.","Sentence2":"And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.","Sentence2":"However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"because we have this very broad reach on both platforms plus the ability to target very specifically.","Sentence2":"In the medium to long run, we believe we compare very favorably with any other spend we can do","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was

progress.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"There's discounted student plans.","Sentence2":"On your first question about Prime penetration, without getting into any statistics on penetration and by country, I would say we do have other options for, if you'll notice, there's the monthly option, obviously provides more flexibility for people who want to try out Prime before committing to the annual plan.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So that\u2019s promising, but we continue to see Europe growing just a bit slower than the rest of the regions.","Sentence2":"And in Marketplace, we definitely are going to focus on some of the areas that you talked about including jobs is already a pretty meaningful focus where a lot of people do find jobs and business is less jobs through Facebook.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So there\u2019s a lot of granularity that goes into thinking about how revenue will progress that ultimately it\u2019s going to depend on the supply and demand characteristics in that given quarter when we do that and we see that we expect constant currency deceleration.","Sentence2":"We are constantly working from an auction perspective.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded.","Sentence2":"we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.","Sentence2":"We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We're growing the number of advertisers and publishers, and we're continuing to see growth and we'll continue to invest.","Sentence2":"We're seeing investment, we're investing in the audience network and we think it's important","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We structure all of our motions at this company, from how we engineer to how we do our go-to-markets to how we think about sales engagement to how we do our investments, fundamentally toward that long-term structural transition in the market.","Sentence2":"But our first priority, every time, is to make sure we are focused on annuity growth and digital transformation at our company, which is best done through that motion.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We spend billions of dollars a year, as Jeff said, on infrastructure, tools and services, not only to allow sellers to sell, but to help themselves more successfully.","Sentence2":"So we have a vested interest in the success of our sellers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It was strong on a unit basis.","Sentence2":"On seller services, I would say it was just a very strong quarter if that's what you're referring to 31% growth in revenue.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"One thing to keep in mind also, as you look at growth rate for Q1, is last year Q1 we talked about in April 1st there was a consumption tax increase in Japan.","Sentence2":"And again, so we're going to continue feed the Prime platform as we talked about, continue to add selection in a lot of categories.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak.","Sentence2":"So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar.","Sentence2":"So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact

guidance on total cost is all-inclusive,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs.","Sentence2":"I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"As you know, our E-to-R, expense-to-revenue ratio, is around 10%.","Sentence2":"And if you look at it there, we were down 5%.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"They had a 16.5% lift in ad recall and then Nielsen\u2019s study showed a nearly 20% incremental reach on Facebook versus TV.","Sentence2":"So, I think that shows that when video is done well, it can have a really big impact on companies large and small on our platform.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I mean there are a lot of communities that can get that -- people who really care about gaming.","Sentence2":"It has connections to the video and kind of live content services that we're building out.","label":0,"pc":"No

it.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"because when you think about Windows 10, what we've seen over the past couple of years is, you're right, a very strong enterprise deployment cycle and real pull for that product inside enterprises, because of the security value prop of the product itself.","Sentence2":"Let me talk about this in two or even a couple of components,","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The consumer value, especially now that we have even all the endpoints covered with Office, the definition of Office and where all it's present is also changed, and that all accrues to consumers being willing to have a subscription relationship with us.","Sentence2":"Overall, we are very excited about the growth we are seeing in Office 365.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I mean, we grew 87% in China.","Sentence2":"These are upgrade any time kind of plans.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"They are, in fact, doing things in advanced analytics and using machine learning, and that's a place where we have some very unique capabilities.","Sentence2":"At this point, I would say it's pretty broad even use cases

earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number.","Sentence2":"It is a return to the attach level we saw before.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"It makes the jobs in our warehouse that much better.","Sentence2":"We think it's been a great addition to our fulfillment capacity.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"People start using E1 then they use E3 and then you start to see the momentum in E5, and we did see that.","Sentence2":"When we mentioned E5, I think that\u2019s frankly encouraging for us because all of these premium offers do best when you start the deployment motion.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So as I mentioned before, running an ad that has a click to Messenger ad that goes into Messenger is just an early example of what's possible.","Sentence2":"Ads for us is a very natural fit for our business, and we have a lot of runway ahead of us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And if you look back three years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago","Sentence2":"In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence.","Sentence2":"And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The second part is the ISVs.","Sentence2":"We are a trusted partner.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"On the demand side, we see a good traction across both platforms, and we're rolling out more ability for advertisers to leverage ads in Stories with more formats and the like.","Sentence2":"Instagram has more heavy usage of Stories, so that's an area of continued growth opportunity because the effective levels of monetization in Stories are lower.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us.","Sentence2":"Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"Thanks for the question.","Sentence2":"And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And that\u2019s something that we have the capability of doing, and we want to be able to do that in a disciplined way.","Sentence2":"But at the same time, we will not shrink away from our ability to go put investment, be it in sales, marketing or product R&D, when we clearly have unique things in secular categories of growth.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company.","Sentence2":"And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is.","Sentence2":"And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The WhatsApp Business app has launched, and we now have more than 3 million people actively using it to test business solutions.","Sentence2":"We're excited about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers, but also really a new functionality.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one.","Sentence2":"But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So, great customer adoption.","Sentence2":"We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"However, that said, I think AR can be huge.","Sentence2":"But regardless, it will be huge.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition.","Sentence2":"I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year.","Sentence2":"We haven\u2019t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that\u2019s what we think.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"They're a Utah-based SMB.","Sentence2":"which shows how immersive that is.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience.","Sentence2":"And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"If the connection is useful for marketers, businesses, and useful for people, then it will grow.","Sentence2":"And we're open to automated bots being useful.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"The other element that is there and it\u2019s very seasonal, it\u2019s always there, it\u2019s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2.","Sentence2":"We\u2019re very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we\u2019re shipping.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"With Watch, a lot of what we're trying to do is make it so the video content that's on Facebook and some of the content that we're acquiring through original programming that people can come together with their friends to watch that content through things like Watch Party and engage and build community that way.","Sentence2":"Overall, what you're going to see from us on video is not just try to optimize for overall watch time, but to optimize for building products that help bring people together and help facilitate real interactions between people.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"but our penetration is low,","Sentence2":"And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated","label":2,"pc":"Attack"},{"Sentence1":"If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.","Sentence2":"We are factoring that in this year, that\u2019s just something we\u2019re expecting.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we also see a point out that you know increasingly what we\u2019re doing is renegotiating or negotiating incremental price decreases for customers who then commit to us long term.","Sentence2":"So that\u2019s another thing to watch, it\u2019s not only the short-term commitment, but also the long-term commitment that we see.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"For sellers, it means they sell more.","Sentence2":"And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We have 6 million advertisers on Facebook, which means we have a lot of opportunity on Instagram, where we only have 2 million advertisers to grow their engagement with us and their spend.","Sentence2":"So we're very pleased with the Instagram result, nothing specifically to highlight from a metrics point of view.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"Videos had a big contribution there.","Sentence2":"On engagement, John, I think we're obviously focused across a number of different dimensions to drive engagement.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So when I think about even the capital allocation per quarter we very carefully look at what is our current utilization forecast, and what our demand forecast is.","Sentence2":"We have driven significant process improvement to essentially make it as efficient as one can make it and that\u2019s a continuous process for us.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And since then, we've built the playbook out that has included building AI tools to identify thousands of fake accounts and groups and pages that violate the policies.","Sentence2":"And in each of these \u2013 going back to 2016, we were \u2013 we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement.","Sentence2":"When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So that's still our mission.","Sentence2":"We've been investing quite openly in a lot of areas and continue to do so.","label":0,"pc":"No

mid-2017.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"and so we feel very good about that.","Sentence2":"And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and that\u2019s obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We continue to expand the list of Prime benefits for customers to make it more valuable, and none is more valuable than FBA, which we've talked a lot about the value of Prime to FBA and vice-versa.","Sentence2":"So that is essentially what we're seeing, and we're certainly pleased with the customer response to those offers globally","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"It's really the transformation from having applications that are silos to becoming more services in the cloud where you can reason about the activity and the data underneath these services to benefit the customers who are using these services.","Sentence2":"So the move to the cloud for our customers and for us is not just about a new way of delivering the same value just as a SaaS service.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we're seeing good early signs","Sentence2":"That was one of our biggest strategic objectives was to get active devices and with Store integrated into the installed base and in the user experience so that we could increase these successful developers.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"but we're pleased with the growth.","Sentence2":"And increasingly, that's happening on Facebook.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side.","Sentence2":"So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"We were not doing that a few years ago.","Sentence2":"When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us.","Sentence2":"I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme.","label":0,"pc":"No relation"},{"Sentence1":"In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers.","Sentence2":"And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So you're seeing declining rate on that basis.","Sentence2":"So on the FX adjusted ARPU growth, I would just really point to the overall revenue growth rate, that's what's driving it.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And we're also in the early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage people once a conversation has started.","Sentence2":"And so, when we think about the format of Messenger, we think about the direct correspondence between a person, either an existing or a potential client or with a business, and we think there are many times in kind of a life cycle of interacting with a business where that's a very attractive opportunity.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network, but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board, as we are with Instagram.","Sentence2":"And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way, and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we have invested in across multiple platforms.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And because of the successful results that we've seen in a number of elections recently, we feel like our road map and our level of preparation is much higher now than it has been.","Sentence2":"2018 is a big year.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We hit 3 million advertisers for Facebook.","Sentence2":"So what you're seeing in our results right now are very strong growth for Facebook and very strong growth for Instagram.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And they optimized their video for the Facebook and Instagram mobile feeds.","Sentence2":"An ad that works really well 30 seconds in other platforms and more traditional platforms can work on ours, but the ones that are optimized and use our targeting really perform better.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"So between January 1 and October 7 of this year, over 68 million people on Facebook in the U.S. made over 1 billion interactions about the

video.","Sentence2":"One is there's this continued progression of people getting richer and richer ways to share what's on their minds.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We've also launched video benefits most recently in Japan, but we have them in the U.K. and Germany.","Sentence2":"We're not going to update our Prime subscription growth beyond what we said last year at the end of last

higher than other quarters.","Sentence2":"The starting point for our expectation would be, the usage growth would be very \u2013 that our growth in infrastructure costs would start with the growth in
