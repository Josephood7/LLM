been working on for a while to improve.","Sentence2":"So we're happy with that and we think that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers.","Sentence2":"Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation

the growth rate decelerated some.","Sentence2":"So it's at 97%, still very strong, year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter in other revenue as I think you're aware, there are a number of components, but the largest by a good margin is the advertising revenue and we are comping a period of rapid growth in the prior year, so that is part of the factor there as you mentioned, but I\u2019d just reiterate, we're continuing to see quite strong adoption across Amazon\u2019s vendors, sellers, authors, all types of advertisers that are utilizing that.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"You're right that historically it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer, but we are seeing some really nice traction.","Sentence2":"We do see growth in the other verticals as well.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past.","Sentence2":"So we have studied the effect that you're talking about, and published the results of our research that show that Facebook is actually, and social media in general, are the most diverse forms of media that are out there.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"We actually had our annuity volume licensing

already seen that content, which is not the state that we want to be in.","Sentence2":"So the state that we're trying to get to and hold ourselves accountable to is where we have these transparency

Music.","label":1,"pc":"Support"},{"Sentence1":"The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come up, and part of what is driving that are real changes in the business as it

CapEx to what\u2019s effectively an Asian peak and so that\u2019s a lower ARPU user base.","Sentence2":"So that does have some impact on capital intensity and part of the driver, where we\u2019re
